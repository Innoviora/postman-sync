# üõ†Ô∏è PostmanSync

**PostmanSync** is a powerful tool to automatically synchronize a read-only public Postman collection to multiple target workspaces.

It intelligently detects changes, supports flexible scheduling, handles rate-limiting, and lets you plug into custom event hooks. Perfect for syncing development, staging, and production environments from a single source.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üîÑ Sync public Postman collections to one or many workspaces
- üïí Schedule-based syncing per workspace or globally
- üß™ Dry-run mode for safe testing
- üì° Events for changes, insertions, updates, and errors
- üîÅ Built-in rate-limiter with API key rotation
- ü™µ Custom logger support with adjustable `logLevel`

---

## üîß Built With

PostmanSync is powered by a set of modern, lightweight, and reliable open-source tools:

- **[pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)** ‚Äì For performant and flexible structured logging (with optional `pino-pretty`)
- **[axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)** ‚Äì For making robust and promise-based HTTP requests
- **[fast-json-patch](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch)** ‚Äì To deeply compare collection JSONs and generate accurate change diffs
- **[node:events](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html)** ‚Äì Native event system for emitting sync lifecycle events
- **TypeScript** ‚Äì Entire codebase is written in TypeScript for strong type-safety and DX

These tools work together to ensure PostmanSync is fast, extensible, and production-ready.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

PostmanSync accepts a single configuration object with the following fields:

### PostmanSyncOptions:

- **readOnlyUrl** (`string`)  
  **Required.** The public Postman collection URL (must include API key). This is the source of truth for syncing.

- **targetWorkspaces** (`WorkspaceConfig[]`)  
  **Required.** An array of workspaces that the collection should be pushed to.

- **dryRun** (`boolean`)  
  Optional. If `true`, no actual sync is performed. Only change detection and logging occur.  
  Default: `false`

- **minIntervalMs** (`number`)  
  Optional. Minimum milliseconds to wait between sync loop executions.  
  Default: `3000`

- **syncSchedule** (`SyncSchedule[]`)  
  Optional. A global sync schedule. Can be overridden by per-workspace schedules.

- **logger** (`Logger`)  
  Optional. A custom logger implementing `.info()`, `.warn()`, and `.error()` methods (e.g., `winston`, `pino`, etc.)

- **storageDir** (`string`)  
  Optional. Path to the directory where internal sync artifacts will be saved  
  (e.g., diff cache, auto-created collection logs, etc.)  
  Default: `.postman-sync-storage`

  > üìÅ This directory is used to store:
  > - Auto-created collection logs (`auto_created.log`)
  > - Cached collection data for change detection
  > - Any other persistent runtime metadata
  >
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to add `storageDir` (e.g., `.postman-sync-storage/`) to your `.gitignore`  
  > to avoid committing logs or temporary sync data to your repository.

- **enableJsonDiff** (`boolean`)  
  Optional. If `true`, enables deep comparison of collection content using JSON diff.  
  Useful for tracking detailed changes (inserted, deleted, modified requests, etc.)  
  Default: `false`

  > üí° When enabled, PostmanSync will persist the latest collection content in the `storageDir`  
  > and compare it against the new version during each sync attempt.  
  > Diff data will be emitted in the `change` event.

- **logLevel** (`"silent" | "error" | "warn" | "info" | "debug"`)  
  Optional. Adjusts the verbosity of logs when using the built-in logger or wraps logging output when a custom logger is provided.  
  Default: `"info"`

  > If a `customLogger` is provided and it has a `.level` property, PostmanSync will attempt to set its level based on `logLevel`.

### WorkspaceConfig:

- **id** (`string`)  
  The Postman workspace ID where the collection should be synced.

- **apiKeys** (`string[]`)  
  One or more Postman API keys. These are used in rotation in case of rate limiting.

- **collectionUid** (`string`)  
  Optional. If omitted and `preventAutoCreate` is false or undefined, a new collection will be created.
  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Auto-created Collections:**  
  > If `collectionUid` is not provided and auto-creation is allowed, a new collection will be created in the specified workspace.  
  > The newly created collection's UID and associated metadata (e.g. workspaceId, readonlyUrl) will be logged to `.${storageDir}/auto_created.log`.  
  > This UID will be used **only for the lifetime of the current process**.  
  > If the process is restarted, a new collection will be created again **unless you manually provide the original UID** in the config.

  ‚úÖ It is **strongly recommended** to copy the auto-created collection UID from the log file and set it explicitly in your configuration using `collectionUid`.  
  This ensures consistent syncing and avoids unnecessary collection sprawl in your Postman workspace.
- 
- **preventAutoCreate** (`boolean`)  
  Optional. If `true`, collection will NOT be auto-created. Useful for strict environments.

- **tag** (`string`)  
  Optional. Label for this workspace used in logs/events 

- **enabled** (`boolean`)  
  Optional. If `false`, the workspace will be skipped.  
  Default: `true`

- **syncSchedule** (`SyncSchedule[]`)  
  Optional. Overrides the global schedule for this specific workspace.

---

### SyncSchedule:

- **startHour** (`number`)  
  Hour of day (0‚Äì23) when syncing should start.

- **endHour** (`number`)  
  Hour of day (0‚Äì23) when syncing should stop (non-inclusive).

- **intervalMinutes** (`number`)  
  How often to attempt sync during the window. Minimum: `0.5` (30 seconds)

---
Note: If a workspace has its own syncSchedule, it overrides the global syncSchedule. This behavior triggers the `scheduleOverride` event.
